Hello,
My steps to run program:
    1 - add main.cpp file in SequenceableCollection.cpp + run using ctrl + alt + n if lazy
    2 - or Open terminal
    3 - replace my sample main.cpp file code with yours and run g++ -o main main.cpp 
    4 - then run ./main

For Main file: 
    1. Make sure to import files correctly
    2. Create an object using SequenceableCollection collection or SequenceableCollection* collections2 = new SequenceableCollection();
    3. Use dot operaotr or -> where needed.
    4. Use sample main.cpp file as a guide.
